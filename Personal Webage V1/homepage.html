        <h1>I'm Jhon Westly A. Carmelotes</h1>
        <p>Graduated at Lyceum of Alabang in August of 2023, Majored in Computer Engineering and was in Dean's List. I completed a 16 week web dev bootcamp last year. Currently no Professional experience</p>
        <br>
        <p>My Hobbies are playing video games competitively, watching anime, reading mangas, manhua, manhwas, exercising, and learning new things.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>My Strengths is i'm able to learn new things fairly quickly and adapt to new situations. I'm a jack of all trades so I often know alot of things to a degree and able to converse to various topics with confidence.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My weakness however is that I often get stuck in a cycle of doubts making it so that I often don't pass when it's already good enough for others. I also said that i'm a jack of all trades so the main weakness is that I don't really master one thing leaving me either in intermediate or novice level rather than that of an expert</p>
